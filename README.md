## GOAL ⚡️

This is the final [Ironhack][id] project. Among other things, it is designed to use some of the tools used throughout the course.

[id]: https://www.ironhack.com/es "Ironhack"
The main objective of Inditex recommender is to make a comparison between garments from different stores, i.e. when you want to buy a certain product you can see the different price options, available stock, store closest to your location and an image of the product.

WHAT IS NEED? TOOLS ⚙️

About the data and tools, I have used Selenium to extract the product information such as ID, URL, image and name.
