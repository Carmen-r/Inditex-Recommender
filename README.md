## GOAL ‚ö°Ô∏è

This is the final [Ironhack][id] project. Among other things, it is designed to use some of the tools used throughout the course.

[id]: https://www.ironhack.com/es "Ironhack"

Many times we have bought a garment for a high price that later we see in other stores for a lower price, that is why the need for an Inditex recommender has arisen.

The main objective of this idea is to make a comparison between garments from different stores, i.e. when you want to buy a certain product you can see the different price options, available stock, store closest to your location and an image of the product. Which simplifies the search time in different stores, and the most important thing is to be able to get the updated stock. 

## WHAT IS NEED? TOOLS ‚öôÔ∏è

About the data and tools, I have used: 

[Selenium][id1] to extract the product information such as ID, URL, image and name.

[API][id2] to get information about the store such as ID, street and information about the opening hours.

[id2]: https://pypi.org/project/ApiDoc/ "API"

[API][id2] for updated stock information. Extract the id of the product and the stores, in addition to the available units.

## STEPS üöÄ

The first steps were to make a project plan and to analyze which tools we were going to use to extract all the data, as well as to study its feasibility.
